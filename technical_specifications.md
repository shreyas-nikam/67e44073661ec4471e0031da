# Technical Specifications for Streamlit Application

## Introduction
The goal of this Streamlit application is to demonstrate and explain a set of learning outcomes, particularly focusing on definitions outlined in an appended document. The application will use a synthetic dataset to visualize data handling and concepts effectively, integrating interactivity and user guidance throughout.

## Application Architecture

### Learning Outcomes

- **Objective**: To create a comprehensive list of definitions from the provided document's appendix and systematically present these concepts within the Streamlit application.
- **Content**: Explanation of terminologies using definitions, enhancing learning experience through interactive visualization and user input.

### Data Handling

- **Dataset Type**: Synthetic dataset
- **Dataset Details**:
  - **Source**: The dataset is artificially generated to closely mimic the structure and nuances of the document.
  - **Content**: Features include numeric values, categorical variables, and time-series data if applicable.
  - **Purpose**: To provide a controlled setting for developing and testing visualization and data manipulation techniques within the application.

### Visualization Techniques

- **Interactive Charts**:
  - **Line Charts**: Show trends over time or across categorical variables.
  - **Bar Graphs**: Compare quantities or frequencies of different categories.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Analyze correlations between two numeric variables.
  
- **Annotations & Tooltips**: Offer detailed explanations embedded directly within the charts to provide context and insights.

### User Interaction

- **Input Forms and Widgets**:
  - Allow users to manipulate input parameters.
  - Enable real-time updates to visualizations based on user input, providing a dynamic exploration experience.
  
- **User Guidance**:
  - Integrated inline documentation and tooltips to assist users in understanding each feature and step of the application.
  
### Additional Details

- **User Experimentation**: The application will include features to let users change input parameters, visualize the effects immediately, and understand the underlying concepts via the dataset.
  
- **Documentation**: Contextual help to navigate through the application effectively, facilitating a self-directed learning approach.

## References

- **Github References**:
  - To support the development process, open-source packages used should be referenced with their respective GitHub repositories, such as:
    - **Streamlit**: [Streamlit Github](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)
    - **Pandas**: [Pandas Github](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
